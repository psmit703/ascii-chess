# General Progress Summary
Have primarily been working on a function to check whether a move is legal or not. I will be splitting time between that and working on the encoding for the chess board itself.
The encoding itself won't be difficult to implement, but right now it's making sure all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed in terms of what fields to have in order to have the functionality that I want.
